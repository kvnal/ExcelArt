### About
* Project was inspired from:
    * [![YouTube](https://img.youtube.com/vi/OrwBc6PwAcY/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrwBc6PwAcY)
* I have used openCV for this project but you can use Pillow (PIL) instead of openCV to get Image pixel value.
* Using fx,fy (in resizing image) less than 1/2 is suggested for optimization and better results.
